                                <p>
                                    It`s not a coincidence that all of the
                                    behind-the-scenes secrets from Pimp My Ride
                                    only started coming out years after the show
                                    went off the air. (Though faster internet
                                    connections and social media probably also
                                    helped with that.) One of the conditions of
                                    being on the show, of course, was signing a
                                    pretty lengthy contract that partially
                                    dictated what the owners were allowed to do
                                    once they were on the show. Don't worry --
                                    it was nothing like a Disney contract, where
                                    talent allegedly signs away their ability to
                                    swear or be a normal teenager while
                                    representing the House of Mouse. However,
                                    participants on the show weren`t allowed to
                                    say that the car was on Pimp My Ride if they
                                    tried to sell it.

                                    If they were going to keep the car for
                                    themselves, they were free to brag about
                                    being on the show. If they decided to sell
                                    their car, however, the gag order was
                                    suddenly in place. There were also
                                    restrictions on which sites could be used to
                                    sell the car in the first place. This was
                                    done to make sure that owners couldn’t try
                                    to inflate the value of the car by saying
                                    that it had been on the show. There were
                                    probably other, more serious reasons why
                                    this provision was in the contract, however
                                    like trying to prevent the public from
                                    finding out about the shady work that was
                                    being done on the car.

                                    the contestants who got to go on the show,
                                    too.) Unfortunately for the owners, though,
                                    not all of the additions to their cars kept
                                    working after they’d driven away from the
                                    shop. In fact, some of them stopped working
                                    within days. It turns out that even though
                                    the shops had the cars for months, that
                                    wasn’t exactly enough time to make sure that
                                    the work was as good as it was supposed to

                                    One of the best parts of the show is seeing
                                    everything come together at the end. The
                                    last few minutes are dedicated to someone
                                    from the shop -- usually Mad Mike -- taking
                                    the owner on a mini-tour of their new car,
                                    showing off all the new additions that
                                    they’ll be able to drive away with. Maybe.
                                    Some of the upgrades to the car were fake
                                    and only there for the cameras. Jake
                                    Glazier, who appeared on season four, said
                                    that his car really needed a new muffler.
                                    This was an issue that he was able to easily
                                    recognize himself even though he doesn’t
                                    work on cars for a living.

                                <p>
                                    Instead of just fixing the muffler, though,
                                    the shop installed a fake exhaust pipe to
                                    make it look like that’s what the car was
                                    supposed to sound like. It clearly wasn’t.
                                    Martino also noted that some of the upgrades
                                    to his car were fake, like a robotic arm
                                    that had been added for no other reason than
                                    to look cool. The arm didn’t actually work
                                    on its own.

                                    It’s not just the owners’ backstories that
                                    MTV likes to embellish, however. They also
                                    make the cars more dramatic so that the end
                                    transformation is even more dramatic.
                                    Anything for a good before and after photo,
                                    right? So even if a contestant already has a
                                    really awful car, sometimes producers would
                                    make it look worse just so that it was even
                                    more shocking when the owner revealed how
                                    awful their car looked. Producers would also
                                    exaggerate damage that was already there. In
                                    one instance, for example, they used
                                    aircraft remover to make the peeling paint
                                    of a car look even worse. They also
                                    completely removed a bumper that was just
                                    hanging off and "enhanced" a dent that had
                                    been caused by something else. Some of the
                                    owners were insulted by this -- their cars
                                    might have been bad, but they weren't as bad
                                    as MTV made them out to be.

                                <p>
                                    In the "Small House, Big Problems" episode,
                                    El Moussa and Haack tackled a three-bed,
                                    two-bath, 1,100 square foot house in
                                    Fullerton, California. The home was in an
                                    undesirable location with a commercial
                                    property right across the street, so the
                                    renovations had to be top-notch to sway
                                    buyers. They purchased the house for
                                    $390,000 and had a renovation budget of
                                    $75,000.  At first sight, one of El Moussa's
                                    pain points was a massive oil stain on the
                                    driveway.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In a dire attempt to avoid paying an
                                    additional $10,000 to replace it, he
                                    enlisted the help of his mom to figure out
                                    how to remove the stain. Sure enough, the
                                    combination of baking soda, soda, and a
                                    pressure washer did the trick! But their
                                    first snag came when they learned that their
                                    outdoor laundry room was not permitted, and
                                    to relocate it inside, the contractors would
                                    have to tear out all of the concrete to move
                                    the laundry drain lines.

                                    They listed the home at $599,000 and
                                    eventually had to lower the price to
                                    $575,000 for it to sell. According to the
                                    episode, they made a $72,700 profit after
                                    closing.

                                    In "Buyer's Remorse," El Moussa and Haack
                                    find a $740,000 hidden gem on a hill in
                                    Yorba Linda, California, with striking views
                                    and a pool. From the beginning, they
                                    struggled to find a design theme that would
                                    have widespread appeal for the various
                                    buyers in the area, but ultimately decided
                                    to go with a modern look. To maximize the
                                    views from the house, they decided to spend
                                    a whopping $11,000 to remove a brick wall
                                    and fireplace to provide uninhibited views
                                    from the living room.

                                    During the bathroom design, El Moussa and
                                    Haack have differing ideas on how much of a
                                    busy black and white tile should be used in
                                    the bathroom. They come to a middle ground
                                    that incorporates parts of both styles, but
                                    El Moussa decides to go rogue and get 100%
                                    of his design installed without Haack
                                    knowing. She reluctantly obliges but decides
                                    to get revenge by making the remaining
                                    fireplace her own design. Originally stone
                                    with different shades of brown, she changes
                                    it to an all-white stucco look.

                                    In the episode "Go Big or Go Home," El
                                    Moussa and Haack enlist the help of their
                                    investor friend to make a go for a five-bed,
                                    5.5-bath, 5,300 square foot house in Anaheim
                                    Hills, California, for $1.45 million. It's
                                    one of their most expensive purchases. The
                                    home boasted striking views as well as a
                                    pool and basketball court.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Instead of just fixing the muffler, though,
                                    the shop installed a fake exhaust pipe to
                                    make it look like that’s what the car was
                                    supposed to sound like. It clearly wasn’t.
                                    Martino also noted that some of the upgrades
                                    to his car were fake, like a robotic arm
                                    that had been added for no other reason than
                                    to look cool. The arm didn’t actually work
                                    on its own -- it was actually being
                                    controlled off-screen by someone entering
                                    commands into a laptop. For the amount of
                                    time that the shop has the cars, you’d think
                                    that they wouldn’t have to resort to
                                    installing fake upgrades just for the
                                    reactions.

                                <h3>Their biggest flop</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Although it's difficult to know exactly how
                                    many flops this duo has experienced (many
                                    episodes end with their houses still being
                                    on the market at the time of air), "Big Lot
                                    Little Flip" checks the box as a bonafide
                                    flop. The property was a two-bed, one-bath
                                    home in Buena Park, California. They were
                                    pleasantly greeted with trash and a disaster
                                    zone of a yard. Despite the landfill in
                                    front of them, El Moussa and Haack were
                                    excited about the large yard because it
                                    presented an opportunity to add a rental
                                    unit to create a multi-family property. 
                                    They purchased the home for $272,000, a
                                    sizable jump from the original asking price
                                    of $240,000. Once they took ownership, they
                                    were hit with two large punches — they could
                                    not build a rental unit on the property
                                    unless they lived there, and the home's
                                    foundation needed a complete lift. This
                                    added a whopping $30,000 expense.
