                                        It`s not a coincidence that all of the
                                        behind-the-scenes secrets from Pimp My
                                        Ride only started coming out years after
                                        the show went off the air. (Though
                                        faster internet connections and social
                                        media probably also helped with that.)
                                        One of the conditions of being on the
                                        show, of course, was signing a pretty
                                        lengthy contract that partially dictated
                                        what the owners were allowed to do once
                                        they were on the show.

                                        Don't worry -- it was nothing like a
                                        Disney contract, where talent allegedly
                                        signs away their ability to swear or be
                                        a normal teenager while representing the
                                        House of Mouse. However, participants on
                                        the show weren`t allowed to say that the
                                        car was on Pimp My Ride if they tried to
                                        sell it. If they were going to keep the
                                        car for themselves, they were free to
                                        brag about being on the show. If they
                                        decided to sell their car, however, the
                                        gag order was suddenly in place.

                                        There were also restrictions on which
                                        sites could be used to sell the car in
                                        the first place. This was done to make
                                        sure that owners couldn’t try to inflate
                                        the value of the car by saying that it
                                        had been on the show. There were
                                        probably other, more serious reasons why
                                        this provision was in the contract,
                                        however like trying to prevent the
                                        public from finding out about the shady
                                        work that was being done on the car.

                                        the finished product. The specialists in
                                        each shop always give a lot of cool
                                        gadgets and tricked out interiors to
                                        each contestant’s car, and seeing how it
                                        all comes together is part of the fun of
                                        the show.

                                        (We’d imagine that it’s the best part
                                        for the contestants who got to go on the
                                        show, too.) Unfortunately for the
                                        owners, though, not all of the additions
                                        to their cars kept working after they’d
                                        driven away from the shop. In fact, some
                                        of them stopped working within days. It
                                        turns out that even though the shops had
                                        the cars for months, that wasn’t exactly
                                        enough time to make sure that the work
                                        was as good as it was supposed to be.

                                        One of the best parts of the show is
                                        seeing everything come together at the
                                        end. The last few minutes are dedicated
                                        to someone from the shop -- usually Mad
                                        Mike -- taking the owner on a mini-tour
                                        of their new car, showing off all the
                                        new additions that they’ll be able to
                                        drive away with. Maybe. Some of the
                                        upgrades to the car were fake and only
                                        there for the cameras. Jake Glazier, who
                                        appeared on season four, said that his
                                        car really needed a new muffler. This
                                        was an issue that he was able to easily
                                        recognize himself even though he doesn’t
                                        work on cars for a living.

                                        Instead of just fixing the muffler,
                                        though, the shop installed a fake
                                        exhaust pipe to make it look like that’s
                                        what the car was supposed to sound like.
                                        It clearly wasn’t. Martino also noted
                                        that some of the upgrades to his car
                                        were fake, like a robotic arm that had
                                        been added for no other reason than to
                                        look cool. The arm didn’t actually work
                                        on its own -- it was actually being
                                        controlled off-screen by someone
                                        entering commands into a laptop. For the
                                        amount of time that the shop has the
                                        cars, you’d think that they wouldn’t
                                        have to resort to installing fake
                                        upgrades just for the reactions.

                                        It’s not just the owners’ backstories
                                        that MTV likes to embellish, however.
                                        They also make the cars more dramatic so
                                        that the end transformation is even more
                                        dramatic. Anything for a good before and
                                        after photo, right? So even if a
                                        contestant already has a really awful
                                        car, sometimes producers would make it
                                        look worse just so that it was even more
                                        shocking when the owner revealed how
                                        awful their car looked. Producers would
                                        also exaggerate damage that was already
                                        there. In one instance, for example,
                                        they used aircraft remover to make the
                                        peeling paint of a car look even worse.
                                        They also completely removed a bumper
                                        that was just hanging off and "enhanced"
                                        a dent that had been caused by something
                                        else. Some of the owners were insulted
                                        by this -- their cars might have been
                                        bad, but they weren't as bad as MTV made
                                        them out to be.

                                        In the "Small House, Big
                                        Problems" episode, El Moussa and Haack
                                        tackled a three-bed, two-bath, 1,100
                                        square foot house in Fullerton,
                                        California. The home was in an
                                        undesirable location with a commercial
                                        property right across the street, so the
                                        renovations had to be top-notch to sway
                                        buyers. They purchased the house for
                                        $390,000 and had a renovation budget of
                                        $75,000.  At first sight, one of El
                                        Moussa's pain points was a massive oil
                                        stain on the driveway.

                                        In a dire attempt to avoid paying an
                                        additional $10,000 to replace it, he
                                        enlisted the help of his mom to figure
                                        out how to remove the stain. Sure
                                        enough, the combination of baking soda,
                                        soda, and a pressure washer did the
                                        trick! But their first snag came when
                                        they learned that their outdoor laundry
                                        room was not permitted, and to relocate
                                        it inside, the contractors would have to
                                        tear out all of the concrete to move the
                                        laundry drain lines.

                                        eventually had to lower the price to
                                        $575,000 for it to sell. According to
                                        the episode, they made a $72,700 profit
                                        after closing costs.

                                        hill in Yorba Linda, California, with
                                        striking views and a pool. From the
                                        beginning, they struggled to find a
                                        design theme that would have widespread
                                        appeal for the various buyers in the
                                        area, but ultimately decided to go with
                                        a modern look. To maximize the views
                                        from the house, they decided to spend a
                                        whopping $11,000 to remove a brick wall
                                        and fireplace to provide uninhibited
                                        views from the living room.

                                        During the bathroom design, El Moussa
                                        and Haack have differing ideas on how
                                        much of a busy black and white tile
                                        should be used in the bathroom. They
                                        come to a middle ground that
                                        incorporates parts of both styles, but
                                        El Moussa decides to go rogue and get
                                        100% of his design installed without
                                        Haack knowing. She reluctantly obliges
                                        but decides to get revenge by making the
                                        remaining fireplace her own design.
                                        Originally stone with different shades
                                        of brown, she changes it to an all-white
                                        stucco look, with a black tile pyramid
                                        going up to the top. Once the
                                        renovations are done, they decide to
                                        list the house for $1,039,000 and go
                                        into escrow at the asking price, giving
                                        them a profit of $163,400.

                                    <p>
                                        In the episode "Go Big or Go Home," El
                                        Moussa and Haack enlist the help of
                                        their investor friend to make a go for a
                                        five-bed, 5.5-bath, 5,300 square foot
                                        house in Anaheim Hills, California, for
                                        $1.45 million. It's one of their most
                                        expensive purchases. The home boasted
                                        striking views as well as a pool and
                                        basketball court.

                                        Instead of just fixing the muffler,
                                        though, the shop installed a fake
                                        exhaust pipe to make it look like that’s
                                        what the car was supposed to sound like.
                                        It clearly wasn’t. Martino also noted
                                        that some of the upgrades to his car
                                        were fake, like a robotic arm that had
                                        been added for no other reason than to
                                        look cool. The arm didn’t actually work
                                        on its own -- it was actually being
                                        controlled off-screen by someone
                                        entering commands into a laptop. For the
                                        amount of time that the shop has the
                                        cars, you’d think that they wouldn’t
                                        have to resort to installing fake
                                        upgrades just for the reactions.

                                        Although it's difficult to know exactly
                                        how many flops this duo has experienced
                                        (many episodes end with their houses
                                        still being on the market at the time of
                                        air), "Big Lot Little Flip" checks the
                                        box as a bonafide flop. The property was
                                        a two-bed, one-bath home in Buena Park,
                                        California. They were pleasantly greeted
                                        with trash and a disaster zone of a
                                        yard. Despite the landfill in front of
                                        them, El Moussa and Haack were excited
                                        about the large yard because it
                                        presented an opportunity to add a rental
                                        unit to create a multi-family property. 
                                        They purchased the home for $272,000, a
                                        sizable jump from the original asking
                                        price of $240,000. Once they took
                                        ownership, they were hit with two large
                                        punches — they could not build a rental
                                        unit on the property unless they lived
                                        there, and the home's foundation needed
                                        a complete lift. This added a whopping
                                        $30,000 expense. They ultimately listed
                                        the house at $399,999, and after a
                                        month, they received an offer for
                                        $400,000. According to HGTV, the buyer
                                        asked El Moussa and Haack to pay their
                                        closing costs, and after they factored
                                        in the renovation, closing, and buyer
                                        costs, they recorded a loss of -$3,330.
